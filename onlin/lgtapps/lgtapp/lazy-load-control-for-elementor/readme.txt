Remove the Lazy Load attribute from specific images in Elementor.

== Description ==

It adds a control to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Elementor</a> image widget to remove the Lazy Load attribute.
Normally, if you use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/">Elementor</a>, also the first image that appears in the viewport is lazy loaded, and this is not good for performance.
By removing the lazy load attribute to the first image that appears in the viewport you can improve the LCP which is an important performance metric.
