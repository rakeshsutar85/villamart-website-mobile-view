Skip typing addresses every time! Allow users to save (and pick from) multiple shipping and billing addresses. Shorten checkout, increase conversions.

== Description ==

Filling in shipping and billing addresses is the most boring part of checking out and completing an order. Nobody likes to type in their address every time they buy something. 

Browser’s address autofill helps, but what about different addresses? Sometimes you want to ship to your home address, sometimes to office. Yet some other times you need to send the order to your parents, kids or friends. 

Amazon uses Saved Addresses and it’s one of the big reasons for their high conversions.

When people see their address during checkout, they trust the store, feel confident and quickly complete checkout.

Saved Addresses for WooCommerce gives you everything you need to achieve that!

Logged-in users can add multiple shipping and billing addresses during checkout - or pick from their previously saved addresses for delivery or for billing. 

No need to type or copy-paste addresses any more.

== Installation ==
